<h2>Complete Graph</h2>
<p>A complete graph is a graph in which every pair of distinct vertices is connected by a unique edge. In a complete graph with 'n' vertices, there are n(n-1)/2 edges.</p>
<p>Complete graphs are often used to model scenarios where every entity is connected to every other entity, like in fully connected networks.</p>
