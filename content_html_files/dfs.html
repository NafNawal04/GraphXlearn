<h2>Depth-First Search (DFS)</h2>
<p>Depth-First Search is a graph traversal algorithm that explores as far along a branch as possible before backtracking. DFS uses a stack data structure to keep track of the path.</p>
<p>DFS is often used for topological sorting, detecting cycles, and pathfinding.</p>
