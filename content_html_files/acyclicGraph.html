<h2>Acyclic Graph</h2>
<p>An acyclic graph is a graph that has no cycles. In other words, itâ€™s a graph in which there is no way to start at a node and traverse a sequence of edges that eventually loops back to the same node.</p>
<p>Examples of acyclic graphs include trees and directed acyclic graphs (DAGs), which are used in various applications such as scheduling and data processing workflows.</p>
