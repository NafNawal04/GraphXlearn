<h2>Directed Graph</h2>
<p>A directed graph (or digraph) is a graph in which edges have directions. This means that traversal from one node to another is possible only in the specified direction of each edge.</p>
<p>Directed graphs are useful in applications such as flowcharts, data processing pipelines, and dependency structures.</p>
