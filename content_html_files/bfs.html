<h2>Breadth-First Search (BFS)</h2>
<p>Breadth-First Search is a graph traversal algorithm that explores nodes level by level. Starting from a selected node, BFS visits all neighbors before moving on to their neighbors.</p>
<p>BFS is commonly used in shortest path finding, such as in unweighted graphs, and is also used in social networking sites to find degrees of separation.</p>
