<h2>Bellman-Ford Algorithm</h2>
<p>The Bellman-Ford algorithm is used to find the shortest paths from a single source vertex to all other vertices in a weighted graph. Unlike Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm, Bellman-Ford can handle graphs with negative edge weights.</p>
<p>Applications include network routing, where costs may include penalties or negative values.</p>
