    <h1>Undirected Graph</h1>
    <p>
        An undirected graph is a graph in which edges do not have any direction. That is, the nodes are unordered pairs in the definition of every edge.

    <h2>Characteristics of an Undirected Graph</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Edges in an undirected graph are bidirectional in nature.</li>
        <li>In an undirected graph, there is no concept of a “parent” or “child” vertex as there is no direction to the edges.</li>
        <li>An undirected graph may contain loops, which are edges that connect a vertex to itself.</li>
        <li>Degree of each vertex is the same as the total number of edges connected to it.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Applications</h2>
    <div class="applications">
        <ul>
            <li><b>Peer-to-Peer Networks</b>: In file-sharing or communication networks where any peer can communicate with any other without directionality.</li>
            <li><b>Social Networks (Friendships)</b>: When friendships are mutual, they are best represented as undirected edges between nodes (individuals).</li>
            <li><b>Collaborative Filtering in Recommendations</b>: Represents users and items with edges indicating associations, with no directed flow needed.</li>
        </ul>
