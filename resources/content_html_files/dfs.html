    <h1>Depth-First Search (DFS)</h1>
    <p>Depth-First Search (DFS) is a graph traversal algorithm that explores each branch of the graph as deeply as possible before moving to the next branch. In DFS, starting from a source node, we visit an adjacent node and recursively visit all its adjacent nodes until all reachable vertices from that node have been visited. Then we backtrack to visit any remaining unvisited adjacent nodes from the source.</p>

    <h2>DFS from a Given Source</h2>
    <p>The DFS algorithm can start from any given source node and explores all reachable vertices by going deeper into each branch. This approach is similar to the Depth-First Traversal of a tree. However, unlike trees, graphs can contain cycles, so DFS uses a boolean visited array to prevent revisiting nodes.</p>

    <h3>Steps of the DFS Algorithm</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Start from the source node and mark it as visited.</li>
        <li>For each adjacent unvisited node:
            <ul>
                <li>Recursively apply DFS on the node.</li>
                <li>Continue until all reachable nodes from the source are visited.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Backtrack and move to any remaining unvisited adjacent nodes from the initial source node.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Example</h3>
    <p>Consider the following graph:</p>

    <h3>Output</h3>

        DFS starting from source 0 :<br>

    <h2>Complexity Analysis of DFS</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Time Complexity:</strong> O(V + E), where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges in the graph.</li>
        <li><strong>Auxiliary Space:</strong> O(V + E), due to the visited array of size V and the stack space for recursive calls.</li>
    </ul>
