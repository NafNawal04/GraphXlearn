    <h1>Breadth-First Search (BFS)</h1>
    <p>Breadth-First Search (BFS) is a fundamental graph traversal algorithm. It begins with a node, traverses all its adjacent nodes first, then moves on to the adjacent nodes of those nodes, continuing in a breadth-first manner. This ensures that nodes are explored level by level.</p>

    <h2>BFS from a Given Source</h2>
    <p>The BFS algorithm starts from a given source node and explores all reachable vertices from this source. It is similar to the Breadth-First Traversal of a tree, but with a key difference: graphs may contain cycles, so nodes may be revisited. To avoid processing a node more than once, BFS uses a boolean visited array.</p>

    <h3>Steps of the BFS Algorithm</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Initialization:</strong> Enqueue the given source vertex into a queue and mark it as visited.</li>
        <li><strong>Exploration:</strong> While the queue is not empty:
            <ul>
                <li>Dequeue a node from the queue and visit it (e.g., print its value).</li>
                <li>For each unvisited neighbor of the dequeued node:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Enqueue the neighbor into the queue.</li>
                        <li>Mark the neighbor as visited.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Termination:</strong> Repeat step 2 until the queue is empty.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>This algorithm ensures that all nodes in the graph are visited in a breadth-first manner, starting from the source node.</p>

    <h3>Output</h3>
    <div class="output">
        BFS starting from node 0: <br>

    <h2>Complexity Analysis of BFS</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Time Complexity:</strong> O(V + E), where V is the number of nodes and E is the number of edges.</li>
        <li><strong>Auxiliary Space:</strong> O(V), where V is the number of nodes.</li>
