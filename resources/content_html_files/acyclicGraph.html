    <h1>Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)</h1>
    <p>
        A directed graph that does not contain any cycles.

    <li>
        There are four vertices labeled
        𝐴,𝐵,𝐸 and 𝐹.This graph contains a cycle.
        The The edges have directions, indicated by arrows. The connections are as follows:
 𝐴
        →
        𝐵,
    
        𝐴
        →
        𝐸,
     𝐵
        →
        𝐹,
       
        𝐹
        →
        𝐸
    </li>
    <li>This graph has no cycles. There is no path that starts and ends at the same vertex while following the directed edges. This acyclic property is a key feature of a DAG.</li>
    <h2>Applications</h2>
    <div class="applications">
        <ul>
            <li><b>Task Scheduling</b>:Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) model dependencies in workflows, such as in project management (e.g., PERT, Gantt charts).</li>
            <li><b>Version Control Systems</b>: Used to track revisions and branches, ensuring no circular dependencies. </li>
