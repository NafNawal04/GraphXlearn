    <h1>Weighted Graph</h1>
    <li>A graph in which the edges are already specified with suitable weight is known as a weighted graph. </li>
    <li>Weighted graphs can be further classified as directed weighted graphs and undirected weighted graphs.</li>

    <h2>Applications</h2>
    <div class="applications">
        <ul>
            <li><b>Spanning trees</b>:Weighted graphs are used to find the minimum spanning tree from graph which depicts the minimal cost to traverse all nodes in the graph.
            </li>
            <li><b>Network Routing</b>:In computer networks, where weights indicate bandwidth or latency, allowing optimized path selection.
