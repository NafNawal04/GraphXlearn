    <h1>Cyclic Graph</h1>
    <p>
        A graph containing at least one cycle is known as a Cyclic graph.

    </p>
    <div class="image-container">

    </div>
    <p>
        There are four vertices labeled
        𝐴,𝐵,𝐸 and 𝐹.This graph contains a cycle. The cycle here is 
        𝐴 → 𝐵 → 𝐹 → 𝐸 → 𝐴,forming a closed loop.
    </p>
    <h2>Applications</h2>
    <div class="applications">
        <ul>
            <li><b>Supply Chain Loops</b>: Used to represent cyclic dependencies, such as feedback loops in inventory and demand.</li>
            <li><b>Control Systems</b>: Models feedback loops where outputs influence inputs in systems like robotics or automatic controls.</li>
        </ul>
